The Tipping Scales is a student-led blog founded by members of the University of Bristol Pro Bono Society's 2020-2021 committee.

Through our articles we seek to explore and engage with issues pertinent to the access of justice, the rule of law, civil liberties, as well as wider societal issues and social issues across the world.

Articles are posted every Thursday.
