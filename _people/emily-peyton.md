Emily is a first-year student studying law and Spanish. She is interested in legal issues related to ethical business practices and worker protection, as well as examining places where the law is found to be lacking or hasnâ€™t caught up with modern society and innovations. As well as law, she is also enthusiastic about education and learning languages, as she is a trained EFL teacher and enjoys travelling, even if it she has to babysit a group of excitable Italian seven year olds to afford it. In her free time, she plays hockey (badly) and invents new and rather questionable dishes in the kitchen.
